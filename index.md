Welcome to the US ATLAS/First-HEP computing bootcamp's tutorial on ATLAS analysis preservation with RECAST! Now that you've seen how docker can preserve the exact computing environment you want and spin up customized applications at a moment's notice, we're going to look at an application of docker being used in ATLAS called RECAST.
